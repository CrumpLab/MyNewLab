## Betcha can't type JHDBZKCO very fast on your first try

This lab activity uses the data from Behmer & Crump (2017) to teach one-factor repeated measures ANOVA with-up follow comparisons

### STUDY DESCRIPTION

Behmer & Crump (2017) used the everyday task of typing on a computer keyboard to ask questions about how people learn to put sequences of actions together. Whenever you type a series of letters on the keyboard, you are putting a sequence of actions together, so typing is task that could be used to measure skilled sequencing. Typing also happens to be a convenient task for measuring sequencing. For example, every time a person types a letter, the timing of the button press and the letter pressed can be measured and stored for later analysis.

Behmer & Crump were interested in asking a few different questions, however, we will simplify everything and talk about replication. First we describe an interesting finding from previous research. Behmer & Crump repeated an experiment that should also produce this same finding. If they succeed in doing this, it means the finding can be replicated, and that it happens in more than one lab.

**Finding from previous resaearch:** Prior research showed that typists do something funny. Skilled typists can type normal words very fast. This suggests they know how to locate all of the letters on the keyboard, and can press each letter very quickly to type words. That part isn't particularly funny. However, if you take really skilled typists and make them type random letters like this:  kwitb dhhgjtryq xkldpt mazhyffdt, guess what happens? They slow down a lot. It's kind of weird that a typist would slow down, after all they can type letters really fast when they appear in words, but not when they appear in random orders...what gives? Last, it turns out that typists are kind of in the middle in terms of speed, if you ask them to type non-words that have similar properties to words, such as: quenp hamlke phwempy.

To summarize, prior research showed that typing speed changes as a function of the structure of the text, roughly in this order from fastest to slowest.

(FASTEST)  Normal Words < Word-like Non-words < Random strings  (SLOWEST)

**Replication question:** Behmer & Crump also measured typists while they typed words, non-words that were English-like, and random strings. They had some additional things they were interested in, but for us, we are interested in whether they would show the same effect. Would they replicate the pattern: Normal words (Fastest) < Word-like Non-words (medium) <- Random strings (Slowest)?


### Study Methods

The authors conducted a repeated measures experiment. A total of 38 subjects were used for the analysis.

**Independent Variable**: The IV Stimulus or typing material had three levels: Normal, Bigrams, and Random. Normal refers to normal 5 letter English words (like truck, or plant). Bigrams refers to non-words that have properties similar to words (e.g., phemt quilp). Random refers to 5 letter strings whose letters were totally random (qmklt gdrzn lprni).

**Dependent Variables**: There were three dependent variables, that all measured different aspects of typing performance. Reaction times (RTs) were defined as the temporal interval between seeing a stimulus (to type), and then starting to type it (first key press). Inter-keystroke intervals (IKSIs) are the times between each key-press. Last, accuracy was also measured (correct or incorrect key-presses)

**The task**: Participants (who happened to also be students from Brooklyn College) sat in front a computer. They were presented with one stimulus (word, bigrams, or random) at a time. As soon as they saw the string of letters, they typed it as quickly and accurately as they could, then they moved on to the next trial. 

Reminder, this is a repeated measures design because each participant typed letter strings from the word, bigrams, and random conditions.

## JAMOVI

In this lab, we will use jamovi to:

1. Conduct and graph a One-Factor Repeated Measures ANOVA
2. Use a post-hoc test to locate differences

### Experiment Background

In this experiment, Behmer and Crump (2017) recruited 38 subjects to type words presented on a screen as quickly as they could. The independent variable was typing material and it had 3 levels: Normal (5 letter English words), Bigrams (5 letter non-words that have properties like real words), and Random (random 5 letter strings). The authors wanted to know whether reaction time (RT) was different according to the type of word being typed.

Dependent Variables: There were three dependent variables, that all measured different aspects of typing performance. Reaction times (RTs) were defined as the temporal interval between seeing a stimulus (to type), and then starting to type it (first key press). Inter-keystroke intervals (IKSIs) are the times between each key-press. Last, accuracy was also measured (correct or incorrect key-presses). For this analysis we will use `Pure RTs` as our one DV.

Nota bene: This is a repeated measures design because each participant typed letter strings from the word, bigrams, and random conditions.

### Conduct a One-Factor Repeated Measures ANOVA

For this part of the tutorial, we will use the file below. [Here](https://github.com/CrumpLab/statisticsLab/blob/master/data/spssdata/BehmerCrumpMeanRTs.sav) is the link; it's called BehmerCrumpMeanRTs.sav. Each person's data is contained within a row: there are 3 measurements corresponding to all stimulus conditions. 

### Post-hoc tests

To find out where the difference among these 3 conditions exists, we will use post-hoc tests in the form of a paired-samples t-test. This method takes 2 groups at a time and tests for pairwise differences. There are three comparisons that can be made here:

1. normal vs. bigram
2. bigram vs. random
3. random vs. normal

We will use a paired-samples t-test instead of an independent-samples t-test because in each comparison, the same people are being remeasured in each group. 

To conduct a one-factor repeated measures ANOVA and post-hocs tests in jamovi, follow these steps, and you will see the rght side of the screen update with the chosen analyses and statistics:

### Practice Problems

1. Run the same analysis as illustrated in this lab tutorial but with accuracy (correct) as the dependent variable. Use an alpha level of .05. Remember to calculate  means per subject and stimulus first. This will generate a table, whose values you can enter into a new SPSS spreadsheet file.

2. Is there an effect of stimulus on error rate? If so, conduct the appropriate planned comparisons.
